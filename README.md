final project looks like this.The main idea of the project is Generate a random password.The program gonna ask you how many letter,number,symbol do you want in your password and depend your answers you are going to have a password.The password doesn't make any sense and this means the password is strong.I used https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Ogre&t= this web site to create symbols.
